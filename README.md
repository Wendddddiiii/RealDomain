# MERN Real Estate Application

## Why I Built This App

I developed this real estate application as a hands-on project to enhance my understanding of the **MERN** stack and to solidify my skills in building full-stack applications. The goal was to create a practical solution that mimics real-world scenarios, allowing users to manage property listings effectively.

## Features
Throughout the development process, I learned:

- **🔑Advanced Authentication**: I gained experience implementing secure user authentication using **JWT**, **Firebase**, and **Google OAuth**, which is essential for modern web applications.
- **🏡CRUD Operations**: I deepened my understanding of **MongoDB** by implementing real-world CRUD operations, which taught me how to interact with databases efficiently.
- **💡User Experience Design**: Enhancing user experience with features like image uploads and property management reinforced the importance of user-centered design in application development.
- **🚀Advanced Search Functionality**: Implementing search features improved my skills in creating intuitive interfaces that cater to user needs.
- Integrated **🛠️ Redux Toolkit** for effective state management across the application.

## 🌐Deployment

Learning to deploy the application on the **Render** platform gave me insights into real-world application deployment processes, including configuration and management of cloud services. Check out the deployed version: https://realdomain-0.onrender.com
